## How I made this

Prior to making this app I had no experience with Flutter. This app was made in less than a day, including setting up the Flutter development environment on my computer. A rough breakdown of the hours spent:

**Hour 0-1**: Setting up the Flutter dev environment and familiarizing myself with the Flutter docs
**Hour 1-2**:
**Hours 2-4**: Work
**Hours 4-6**: Creating documentation, building APKs, uplading to Appetize, etc.
